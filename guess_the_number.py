# Import random module for this program
import random
'''
The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user.
The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.)
If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low).
If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear.
